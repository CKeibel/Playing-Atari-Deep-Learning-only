Playing Atari without Reinforcement Learning. (Deep Learning only) <br>
Projektarbeit -> Proof of Concept f√ºr [Bachelorarbeit](https://github.com/CKeibel/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning)
1. self generated Dataset by Random Playing (adding env wrapper grayscale to reduce dim and gpu memory)
2. add Framestack (for context)
3. Replay Memory, explore (via Greedy) and save good actions to get better dataset samples
